# JAYASURYA — Portfolio (GitHub Pages-ready)

This is a simple static portfolio site modeled after sivap17.github.io and personalized for **JAYASURYA**.

## Setup

1. Create a new GitHub repository named `yourusername.github.io` (replace `yourusername`).
2. Place the files from this project at the repository root:
   - `index.html`
   - `about.html`
   - `css/style.css`
   - `js/main.js`
   - `assets/profile.jpg`  ← **replace with your uploaded photo** (rename it exactly `profile.jpg`)
3. Commit & push.
4. Open `https://yourusername.github.io` after a minute or two (GitHub Pages serves automatically for `username.github.io` repos).

## Personalization
- Change email in both HTML files if needed (currently `jayasurya2005tfg@gmail.com`).
- Instagram link is set to: `https://www.instagram.com/_itz_me_js?igsh=MThnejBsdnF0ZWM3OA%3D%3D&utm_source=qr`
- Fonts load via Google Fonts (Inter). If you prefer a local font, replace the link.

## Notes
- The profile image file should be located at `assets/profile.jpg`.
- Site is responsive and minimal; feel free to tweak CSS variables at the top of `css/style.css` for colors, spacing, etc.
